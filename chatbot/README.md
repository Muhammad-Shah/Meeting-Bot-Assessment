- **Fallback Support**: Graceful handling when database is unavailable

## üîÅ Prompt Routing Logic: How Prompts Are Classified and Routed

The prompt routing system is the intelligence center that determines how each user message should be handled. This sophisticated classification system ensures users get the most appropriate response type.

### Intent Classification Process

#### Step 1: Context Preparation
```python
# Recent chat history is formatted for context
recent_messages = chat_history[-3:]  # Last 3 messages
history_context = "\n".join([
    f"{msg['sender']}: {msg['content']}" 
    for msg in recent_messages
])
```

#### Step 2: AI-Powered Classification
The system uses a specialized GPT-4 prompt to analyze:
- **User's current message**: The exact text and phrasing
- **Recent conversation context**: Previous 3 exchanges for continuity
- **Intent patterns**: Learned patterns for different request types

#### Step 3: Intent Mapping and Routing

```python
# Classification prompt template
router_prompt = """
You are a smart intent classifier for a meeting transcript chatbot.

Classify the user's message into one of these intents:
- "summarize": User wants a summary of the meeting or specific topics
- "question_answer": User is asking specific questions about the meeting content  
- "general_chat": General conversation not directly related to meeting content
- "clarification": User is asking for clarification of previous responses

User message: {message}
Chat history context: {chat_history}

Return ONLY the intent name: summarize, question_answer, general_chat, or clarification
"""
```

### Routing Decision Tree

**SUMMARIZE Intent** ‚Üí `TranscriptSummarizer`
- Triggers when users ask for overviews, summaries, or main points
- Examples: "Summarize this meeting", "What were the key topics?"

**QUESTION_ANSWER Intent** ‚Üí `QuestionAnsweringSystem`  
- Routes specific factual questions about meeting content
- Examples: "Who said X?", "What action items were assigned?"

**CLARIFICATION Intent** ‚Üí `QuestionAnsweringSystem`
- Handles follow-up questions about previous responses
- Examples: "Can you clarify that?", "What did you mean by..."

**GENERAL_CHAT Intent** ‚Üí `General Chat Handler`
- Manages casual conversation and off-topic discussions
- Examples: "Hello", "Thank you", "How are you?"

### Fallback Strategy

```python
# Robust fallback logic
try:
    intent_str = result.strip().lower()
    if intent_str == "summarize":
        return Intent.SUMMARIZE
    elif intent_str == "question_answer":
        return Intent.QUESTION_ANSWER
    elif intent_str == "clarification":
        return Intent.CLARIFICATION
    else:
        return Intent.GENERAL_CHAT  # Safe fallback
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error in intent classification: {e}")
    return Intent.GENERAL_CHAT  # Always provide a response
```

### Smart Context Handling

The routing system considers:
- **Message semantics**: What the user is actually asking for
- **Conversation flow**: Whether this is a follow-up or new topic
- **Session state**: Whether a transcript has been uploaded
- **Historical patterns**: Learning from previous successful classifications

This intelligent routing ensures users always get responses from the most appropriate specialized handler, leading to more accurate and helpful interactions.

## Code Structure

### Main Classes

#### `MeetingBotEngine`
The main orchestrator that:
- Initializes all components
- Routes messages to appropriate handlers
- Manages the overall conversation flow

```python
engine = MeetingBotEngine()
response = engine.process_message(user_message, session_data)
```

#### `Intent` Enum
Defines the four types of user intents:
```python
class Intent(Enum):
    SUMMARIZE = "summarize"
    QUESTION_ANSWER = "question_answer"
    GENERAL_CHAT = "general_chat"
    CLARIFICATION = "clarification"
```

### Key Methods

#### `respond(user_message, session_data)`
Main entry point for the chatbot. This function:
1. Creates a new `MeetingBotEngine` instance
2. Processes the user message
3. Returns the AI response

#### `process_message(user_message, session_data)`
Core processing logic that:
1. Extracts transcript and chat history from session data
2. Classifies the user's intent
3. Routes to appropriate handler
4. Returns the response

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://localhost:27017/  # Optional
DEBUG=True  # Optional
```

### Model Configuration

The engine uses GPT-4 with the following settings:
- **Model**: `gpt-4`
- **Temperature**: `0.1` (for consistent, focused responses)
- **API Key**: Loaded from environment variables

## Error Handling

The system implements comprehensive error handling:

1. **API Failures**: Graceful fallback messages when OpenAI API is unavailable
2. **Invalid Input**: Handles empty or malformed transcripts
3. **Session Errors**: Clear messaging when sessions are not found
4. **Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

### Example Error Messages

- `"Please upload a meeting transcript first so I can help you analyze it."`
- `"I apologize, but I encountered an error while processing your message. Please try again."`
- `"The transcript appears to be too short or empty to provide a meaningful summary."`

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Engine Caching**: The engine could be cached for better performance instead of creating new instances
2. **Model Selection**: Switch to `gpt-3.5-turbo` for faster responses
3. **Chunking Strategy**: Optimized text splitting for large transcripts
4. **Streaming**: Consider implementing streaming responses for long operations

### Current Limitations

- Engine instance created per request (could be optimized)
- MongoDB integration disabled (uses in-memory storage)
- Synchronous processing (could implement async for better performance)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from chatbot.engine import respond

session_data = {
    'transcript': 'Meeting transcript text...',
    'chat_history': [],
    'session_id': 'session_123'
}

response = respond("Summarize this meeting", session_data)
print(response)
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
from chatbot.engine import MeetingBotEngine

# Initialize engine once (recommended for performance)
engine = MeetingBotEngine()

# Process multiple messages
responses = []
for message in user_messages:
    response = engine.process_message(message, session_data)
    responses.append(response)
    
    # Update chat history
    session_data['chat_history'].extend([
        {'sender': 'user', 'content': message},
        {'sender': 'bot', 'content': response}
    ])
```
